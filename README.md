# Banjo Health App

This is the take home test app for Banjo Health. This app can create new orders via a form and send them to the database through the GraphQL API.

## How to

Clone the repo and run `yarn install` followed by `yarn dev` to get a local copy running. The local source is hooked up to the live GraphQL database.
